/** \file
 * \brief Services is an object that allows us to run one service.
 *
 * The following are the states as the services understands them.
 *
 * A service in the "Ready Service" state runs its process whenever
 * it can. Whenever a process gets registered, an event occurs and
 * services that are ready and now got all of their dependencies
 * satisfied get started.
 *
 * Note: the "Paused Service" is the same as "Ready Service" with a
 * longer pause interval (timer) and the action of forcing all
 * pre-requisits to stop running (i.e. go back to "Ready Service").
 *
 * Note: the "Stopped Service" status is actually a service that
 * removed itself from the snap_init class.
 *
 * \todo
 * The following does not correctly support the case where the
 * snapcommunicator crashes.
 *
 * \code

 *
 * The process of stopping a service is a sub-state machine described below.
 * This process is in active mode is the current service state is
 * STOPPING or PAUSING.
 *
 * It can be resumed in a few steps: send a STOP command (if registered),
 * if still running, send a SIGTERM, if still running, send a SIGKILL.
 * In all cases, whether a process is still running is determined by the
 * receipt of the SIGCHLD signal. If the SIGKILL fails, then snapinit
 * attempts to exit.

 * Once started a process generally does not require a timer so
 * it gets disabled. However, a cron task will instead get a
 * timeout setup to its next tick. If that tick happens while
 * the process is still running, then the tick is skipped and
 * the next one is calculated.
 *
 * \li Stop process
 *
 * When the process was asked to stop (i.e. the snapinit process
 * sent a STOP message to the snapcommunicator,) this function
 * sends the signal f_stopping_signal using kill(). At first, the signal
 * is SIGTERM and then SIGKILL. If both signals fail to stop
