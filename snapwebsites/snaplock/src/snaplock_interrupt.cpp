 *
 * Description:
 *      A daemon to synchronize processes between any number of computers
 *      by blocking all of them but one.
 *
 *      The interrupt implementation listens for the Ctrl-C or SIGINT Unix
 *      signal. When the signal is received, it calls the stop function
 *      of the snaplock object to simulate us receiving a STOP message.
