  <description>
    <p>The snapfirewall daemon allows enforcing strong firewall
    rules from any computer in your cluster.</p>

    <p>It should be installed on all systems.</p>

    <p>Note that the firewall requires the snapdbproxy package
    since it makes use of the database to manage the list
    of IP addresses to block.</p>

    <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> the IP address that
    the VPN generates for your computers are NOT used with the
    firewall because all those IP addresses are virtual and
    they do not interact with the firewall at all. So, in the
    following questions, you do not have to enter any IP
    addresses that your VPN generates.</p>
